If yes, have you considered of building your career in mass communication?\\u00a0Mass communication is the process of reaching out to a large number of targeted audiences through the use of mass media like tv, newspapers, magazines, advertisements, social media, radio etc. The means of creation of the message and selection of the right medium to spread it across both are essential in mass communication. Mass Communication is a broad field, which is a combination of journalism, advertising, public relation, photography, film making, content writing etc.Note: Mass communication and journalism both are different. Journalism is a part of mass communication but mass communication is not a part of journalism.Example: The most recent example is the coronavirus epidemic. The rapid outbreak of this virus has made it to an international emergency. Mass communication, in this case, has helped in spreading awareness amongst people and current happening about this epidemic.\"\n",

Business can be service-based, product-based or process-based. As an entrepreneur, you should develop your overall skills in product designing, marketing, selling, time management and also money management. Life of an entrepreneur is very flexible but also challenging. An entrepreneur has to be very hardworking, persistence, structured, well organised and a very brilliant leader.\\u00a0\\u00a0Example: Today, when you hear apple, the first thought that comes to your mind is Steve Jobs and not the fruit. It fits as a perfect example of a successful entrepreneur, whose success is self-explanatory. He did not build this overnight, he too started as a small start-up and stuck to it till the end.

What if you could do all of this at a single place and also built a career from it? If yes, you should become an air hostess or flight attendant.\\u00a0A flight attendant looks after the passengers in the flight from start to end of their journey. Safety and need are of paramount importance. They are known as the cabin crew. As a flight attendant, you have to be very polite, respectful, and look after the safety of the passengers, and their needs (food, water, medicines). In general, you have to make the journey of your passenger as comfortable and safe as possible.\\u00a0The cabin crew are highly trained for any emergencies like lack of oxygen, emergency landings and turbulence. The best part is that you get to travel domestically and internationally as a part of your job.\\u00a0Example: We all have heard about the brave flight attendant Neerja Bhanot. She serves as the best example of how the cabin crew should consider the safety of their passenger as their primary responsibility. She also sets an example of spontaneous decision making abilities at the time of crisis.\"\n",

If yes, you should explore the career option of fishery science.\\u00a0\\u00a0The term fishery refers to the action of catching or rearing fish through farming or aquaculture(the rearing of aquatic animals or the cultivation of aquatic plants for food). \\u00a0Fishery involves rearing, catching, processing, packing and selling and conservation of the fish. Fishery science is the way of getting formal education about this entire process.\\u00a0There are plenty of job opportunities under the private and government sector.\\u00a0An aspirant can own their own fisheries-related business.

If yes, you should consider to pursue your career as an optometrist.\\u00a0Optometrists are the technicians who examine eyes issues. Optometrists are professionals with technical knowledge about visual disorder. The main point to be noted here is that an optometrist is not a doctor. Their primary responsibility is to diagnose eye-related defects like near-sightedness, farsightedness, or other visual impairments. An optometrist should always work in a structured manner with precision and accuracy, and they should be comfortable in handling advance instruments used to detect visual defects.Example:\\u00a0 When a person is facing an issue such as blur sight, he visits an optometrist who would examine his vision capabilities using various advanced tools and thus provide an appropriate report which can be further referred to a doctor for treatment.\"\n",

This similarity between the child and the parent has a scientific reason, the genes.\\u00a0Genetics is the study of the heredity factor, which is transferred from a parent to their offsprings. Every child inherits certain traits, with few variations, from their parents like hair texture, eye colour, hair colour, height and skin colour.There is also a high possibility that certain diseases or disorders are transmitted through the genes to the offsprings. Genetics is the study of such genes their distribution, behaviours and structure in the human body.\\u00a0There are various job opportunities in this field like the genetic counsellor, clinical researcher and research scientist.\\u00a0\\u00a0Example:\\u00a0James D.

Archaeologist analyses and comprehend the human culture through the physical remains of the past of the present.\\u00a0Archaeology has many branches like study human remains (bioarchaeology), animals (zooarchaeology), ancient plants (paleoethnobotany), stone tools (lithics), etc.In India, most of the archaeologist works in the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

If yes, Biotechnology is the option for you!\\u00a0Biotechnology is the application of principles of biology along with recent technology to produce products that can help human and environment. It is the manipulation of genes to create solutions that address modern-day challenges like food supply, diseases, and environmental issues. New products are developed every year under this branch, like medicines, vaccines, biofuels and biochemical.\\u00a0\\u00a0Agricultural Biotechnology is very popular. Through the use of Agricultural Biotechnology, you can research scaling up the grains, making plants pest resistant, drought resistance and stress-tolerant.\\u00a0\\u00a0Example: Bt cotton is the best example of the use of biotechnology in our life. Bt cotton is the genetically modified cotton plant which is pest resistant, which means it is protected from the pest attack to reduce crop loss.

If yes, you should consider a career in supply chain management.Supply Chain Management is all about managing the flow of goods and services from the purchase of raw materials until it reaches the end-user. It is a series of planned events that helps in the delivery of the right product in the right place at the right time. A supply chain is the connected network of individuals, manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, technologies and processes.Example: Zara, the clothing brand is considered to have one of the most structured and organised SCM, right from the production to its global distribution.\"\n",

This integration of biology, along with computational tools gives rise to the field of bioinformatics.\\u00a0This field is the integration of mathematics, statistics, biology, and computer science. With the help of bioinformatics, complex biological data can be analysed very quickly. The primary work of a bioinformatician is to develop codes and software for analysing biological database and samples. A bioinformatician makes scientific research more achievable.\\u00a0Example: Through this field, you would code for different software that would handle the biological databases. For example, the human body has many proteins that play a critical role in our daily body functions. Dysfunction of any such protein can lead to a malfunction in our body.
